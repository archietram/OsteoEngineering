			<p>Abstract:</p>
			<p>Traditionally cells have been cultured in a 2-dimensional environment, however, in vitro culture of tissue on 3-dimensional scaffolds has given rise to perfusion culture systems, which are expensive and complicated to design and run in-house. The Osteo-Engineering Lab is developing a cost-effective perfusion bioreactor system to enable cell proliferation and differentiation on 3D printed poly(propylene fumarate) scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. A major concern is cell viability and scaffolds are needed to validate the system before further steps can be taken towards patient implantation.</p>
