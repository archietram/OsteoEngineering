			<h3>Archie Tram</h3>
			<p>Started: September 2013</p>
			<p>Archie Tram is a Biomedical Engineering major at The Ohio State University, planning to graduate in Spring 2016. He is from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He is planning to pursue an MD/PhD dual degree training after graduation. He works with Dr. Jason Walker on designing and characterizing the scaffolds, which are 3D-printed structures that could degrade in the body and provide surface area for stem cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. He also created and maintains the lab website.
